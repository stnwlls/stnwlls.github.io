                <h6><b>Best for students</b></h6>
                <p>There are few better places to visit that offer more history than the U.S. Capital. Everywhere you turn there’s a monument or landmark. D.C. is also a hub for the best museums in the country (and free)! From the National Museum of Natural History, Air and Space Museum or the Museum of the American Indian, there are so many travelers are able to learn about and do on a tight budget.
                In terms of getting around, the city's metro system is incredibly user-friendly and allows travelers to hop from place to place without spending a chunk of their travel budget on taxis or Uber.

                <h6><b>Outdoor Road Trips</b></h6>
                <p>Outdoor Road Trips are a great way to stay safe while traveling. It’s the best of both worlds; allowing you to travel to different locations while maintaining social distance by exploring nature! Pack Up + Go has various options on where to stay during your Outdoors Trip including cabins, glamping style yurts + tents, bed + breakfasts, and unique inns.
                Outdoor Trips also allow a fresh spin on the traditional vacation and allow you to get active and explore. If you’re looking to hike, bike, climb, kayak, zipline, or just get time to finally relax, then this is the trip type for you.

                <h6><b>Staycation central</b></h6>
                <p>Experience your local cities in a brand new way!
                Staycations are an opportunity for you to hit those bucket list items that you haven’t gotten the chance to see yet, visit the newest restaurants that you’ve been wanting to try, and explore off-the-beaten-path activities that will help make you feel like a tourist in your own city. No long distance road trips, airports or noisy trains, staycations are 100% fun in the city you love. Bring the family, bring the in-laws, bring your friends, everyone can share in this vacation adventure that is waiting to happen.

                <h6><b>Heli-skiing anyone?</b></h6>
                <p>It's no secret that the Alps are home to world-class skiing. But for those who want exclusive access to untouched powder and secluded wilderness, there's nothing like a heli-skiing trip to make you feel like the world's your own private playground. At the northern edge of Piedmont, Val Formazza offers all the isolation you'll need.
                The protected valley is surrounded by three majestic peaks: Ofenhorn, Blinnenhorn, and Basòdino. And because it's so high up (the highest landing spot available is around 10,500 feet), the area receives an average of 4 feet of snow per year.
