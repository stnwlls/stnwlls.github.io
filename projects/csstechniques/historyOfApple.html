                <h1>History of Apple Inc.</h1>
                            
                <h2>Founding</h2>
                <p>Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976. The company was initially established to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Wayne sold his shares of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800. The founding of Apple Inc. marked the beginning of a journey that would redefine personal computing, with a focus on innovation and user-friendly technology.</p>
                <p>From its humble beginnings in a garage, Apple's founders envisioned a future where technology would be accessible to everyone. This vision laid the groundwork for the company's ethos of simplicity and elegance in design, which continues to define Apple products today.</p>
                            
                <h2>Early Success</h2>
                <p>The Apple II, released in 1977, was a significant success and helped establish Apple Inc. as a major player in the personal computer market. It featured color graphics and an open architecture, setting it apart from its competitors. This early success catapulted Apple into the forefront of technological innovation, paving the way for future breakthroughs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Apple II introduced color graphics and an open architecture.</li>
                    <li>It appealed to both consumers and businesses.</li>
                    <li>The Apple II set a new standard for personal computing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With the Apple II, Apple introduced innovations that appealed to both consumers and businesses, solidifying its position in the burgeoning personal computing industry. The Apple II's user-friendly interface and robust software ecosystem set a new standard for what a personal computer could achieve.</p>
                            
                <h2>IPO</h2>
                <p>Apple Inc. went public in December 1980, offering 4.6 million shares at $22 per share. The IPO generated more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956, instantly creating more millionaires than any company in history. The IPO marked a pivotal moment in Apple's history, propelling the company into a new phase of growth and innovation.</p>
                <p>With the success of the IPO, Apple expanded its operations and invested heavily in research and development. This period of rapid expansion laid the foundation for future products that would redefine consumer electronics and shape the digital landscape.</p>
                            
                <h2>Macintosh</h2>
                <p>In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse. The Macintosh revolutionized the computer industry but faced stiff competition from IBM and Microsoft. The Macintosh's intuitive design and graphical user interface set a new standard for personal computing.</p>
                <p>With the Macintosh, Apple introduced innovations that would influence the entire industry. The graphical user interface made computers more accessible to non-technical users, democratizing technology and paving the way for future advancements in user interface design.</p>

                <h2>Jobs' Departure</h2>
                <p>Steve Jobs resigned from Apple Inc. in 1985 after a power struggle with the company's board of directors. He went on to found NeXT, a company that developed high-end computers for the education market. Jobs' departure marked a turbulent period for Apple, as the company struggled to maintain its innovative edge without its visionary co-founder.</p>
                <div><p>Jobs' departure marked a turbulent period for Apple</p></div>
                <p>During Jobs' absence, Apple faced challenges in adapting to changing market dynamics and increasing competition. Despite these challenges, Apple continued to innovate and release new products, albeit without the same level of groundbreaking innovation that characterized Jobs' tenure.</p>
            
                <h2>Jobs' Return and Apple's Renaissance</h2>
                <p>Apple's trajectory changed dramatically in 1997 when Jobs returned to lead the company once again. His return marked a resurgence for Apple, marked by transformative products like the iMac, iPod, and later the iPhone, which revolutionized consumer electronics and solidified Apple Inc.'s position as a leader in innovation.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The iMac, introduced in 1998, revitalized Apple's product lineup with its sleek design and advanced functionality.</li>
                    <li>The iPod, launched in 2001, revolutionized the music industry and transformed how people listened to music.</li>
                    <li>The iPhone, introduced in 2007, redefined the smartphone market with its touchscreen interface and intuitive user experience.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Looking forward, Apple continues to innovate across its product lines, including the iPad and the Apple Watch, driven by a commitment to design excellence, user experience, and technological advancement.</p>
